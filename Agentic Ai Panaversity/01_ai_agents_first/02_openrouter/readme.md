## 🧠 **What is OpenRouter?**

* **OpenRouter** is a platform that provides **a unified interface** for accessing **200+ large language models (LLMs)**.
* It works with both **commercial providers** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) and **open-source models** (LLaMA, Mistral, etc.).
* It functions primarily as a **proxy**, routing requests to third-party APIs.
* It simplifies development by using a **single API endpoint** compatible with the **OpenAI Chat Completion API**.

---

## 🛠️ **Developer Benefits**

* You can **switch between models** just by changing the model name—**no code changes required**.
* Compatible with **OpenAI Agents SDK** and supports **function/tool calling** (like calling weather APIs).
* Offers both an **API for devs** and a **UI chatroom** for casual use or testing.

---

## 🔌 **API Compatibility**

* OpenRouter mirrors the structure of the OpenAI API:

  * `/v1/chat/completions`
  * Parameters like `model`, `messages`, `temperature`, etc.
* Easy to integrate with existing codebases using OpenAI.

---

## 📲 **User Interface**

* Provides a **chatroom** at [openrouter.ai/chat](https://openrouter.ai/chat) where you can chat with multiple LLMs.
* Lets you:

  * Monitor usage
  * Track token consumption
  * Manage credits

---

## 📦 **Function Calling Support**

* Supports **standardized function calling**, similar to OpenAI’s tool calling interface.
* Not all models support this—OpenRouter **routes only to compatible models** when tools are included.

---

## 🌐 **Model Hosting**

* OpenRouter **does not host models**.
* It acts as a **middleman** between your API call and the model provider (like Together AI, Fireworks, AWS).
* Handles authentication, routing, response formatting.

---

## 💸 **Pricing and Free Tiers**

* Some models are **free to use**, but come with rate limits.
* **Free models** often have:

  * **20 requests per minute (RPM)**
  * **200 requests per day (RPD)**
* Paid models operate on a **pay-per-token** model.
* **Transparent pricing** based on upstream provider + OpenRouter's fees.

## 📊 **Rate Limits Summary**

| Platform                   | Limit Type | Value         |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| **OpenRouter Free Models** | RPD        | 200/day       |
|                            | RPM        | 20/min        |
| **Google Gemini (Flash)**  | RPD        | 1,500/day     |
|                            | RPM        | 15/min        |
|                            | TPM        | 1,000,000/min |

* Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite are preferred for development due to higher limits.

## 📘 **Free Models on OpenRouter**

* As of **March 2025**, OpenRouter offers:

  * **50 free models**
  * Including **6 models** with **1 million+ token context windows**
* Free models are often tagged with **`:free`** (e.g., `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free`).
* Ideal for **light usage**, **testing**, and **personal projects**.

---

## 🧪 **Use Cases & Ecosystem**

* Ideal for:

  * Testing and comparing LLMs
  * AI development with fallback options
  * Agentic AI systems using tools/functions
* Integrates with:

  * **LangChain**
  * **OpenAI SDK**
  * **Python scripts** via Quickstart guide

---

## 🔍 **Comparative Insights**

* **Easier** than managing multiple API keys for different providers.
* Offers **high flexibility**, **cost efficiency**, and **broad access** to LLMs.
* Not all “free” models are consistently free—some reports show inconsistencies.
