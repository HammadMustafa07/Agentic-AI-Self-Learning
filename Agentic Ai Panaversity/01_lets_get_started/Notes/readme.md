llm : The core intelligence driving the agent is a large language model.

Iterative Loop: Agents function through a continuous cycle of planning, acting, and observing (e.g., a "think-act-observe" process).

Tools: They leverage external functions or APIs to interact with the world (e.g., search, fetch data, send messages).

Environmental Feedback: Results from tools or external inputs guide the agent’s next steps.

Autonomous Planning and Execution: Agents dynamically decide their actions without a fixed script, adapting to achieve objectives.

Human Checkpoints (Often): Human intervention is frequently included for validation or critical decisions, balancing autonomy with control.

ChatCompletionApi : The Chat Completion API lets developers send a series of messages (like a chat conversation) to an AI model, and the model replies intelligently.
In agentic AI systems, this API is used like the AI's brain — it processes input, thinks, plans actions, and decides what to do next.

Responses API: Responses API includes everything the Chat Completion API can do — and more.
In other words, the Responses API is a newer, more powerful version of the Chat Completion API. It keeps all the features you’re used to, but adds extra capabilities specifically built for agentic AI (like tool use, memory, file handling, and step-by-step planning).
