Swarm Pattern: it was the first experimantal framework of ai agents
Anthropic desing patterns : Anthropic design patterns help AI agents act in a way that respects human goals, safety, and understanding — just like a responsible assistant would.

AnthropicDesignPatterns: {
  prompt: "chaining: breaking its task into small chunks(small parts)",

  chaining: "Breaking a big task into smaller parts and solving them step-by-step (like writing a story, then proofreading it).",
  
  routing: "One agent assigning a task to another agent that is better at that task (like calling an expert).",
  
  parallelization: "Solving different parts of a task at the same time using multiple agents (like a team working together to save time).",
  
  orchestration: "A main agent acts like a project manager — deciding who does what, in what order, and when to stop or continue.",
  
  optimizer: "Improving the quality or efficiency of the task — either by reviewing, retrying, or choosing the best result among many options."
}
