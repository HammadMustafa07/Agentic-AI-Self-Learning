# 🌦️ Welcome to the Weather Agent!  

Hi there! 👋  
I'm your **AI Weather Assistant**, built with the power of **OpenAI Agents SDK**, **Gemini via OpenRouter**, and **Chainlit**.

---

## 🧠 What I Can Do

🔍 **Answer weather-related questions** in real time.  
🌤️ **Fetch live weather updates** for any city.  
🚫 **Ignore non-weather questions** using intelligent input/output guardrails.  
🛡️ **Stay focused** and safe by never going off-topic.

---

## 🤖 How to Use Me

Just type something like:

- **"What's the weather in Lahore?"**
- **"Tell me the current temperature in New York."**
- **"Is it raining in Tokyo?"**

⚠️ If you ask something off-topic (like jokes or math problems), I’ll politely let you know I’m here only for the weather. 😉
