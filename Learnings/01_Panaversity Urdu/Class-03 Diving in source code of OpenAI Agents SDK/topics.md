DATA CLASSES = {
    [Python dataclasses simplify class creation by auto-generating methods like __init__, __repr__, and __eq__ for data-holding classes.
They support default values, comparison, immutability (frozen=True), and post-initialization logic with __post_init__().
Dataclasses make your code cleaner, reducing boilerplate — perfect for models, DTOs, or structured data.]
}

__call__ method = {
    __call__ is a special method in Python that lets an object be called like a function.
When you use object(), Python runs the object's __call__ method automatically.
It’s useful for creating callable objects like function wrappers or stateful functions.
