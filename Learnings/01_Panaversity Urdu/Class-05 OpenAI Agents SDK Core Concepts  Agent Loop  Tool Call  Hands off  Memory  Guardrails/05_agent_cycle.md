# 📝 How Agents Work with LLM, Memory, and APIs

## 🗺️ System Diagram

```
            🧠 Memory Layer

      🔄 Agent Loop (OpenAI Agents SDK)

💬 ChatCompletion API / Responses API

🌐 REST API

🤖 LLM (Large Language Model)
```

## 🤖 LLM: How It Works

When we send a request to the LLM, we send:

- 📝 **System Prompt** (instructions)
- 💬 **User Prompt** (user’s message)

🛠️ **What we get back:**

- 🔧 **Tool Reference** (LLM may suggest tools to run)

---

## 🧠 Memory Layer

> The memory layer helps agents **remember past chats, user info, or tasks**  
> so they give better answers and handle longer conversations.

- ❗ **Not built-in with OpenAI SDK** — You must build it yourself!
- 💾 Save chat history and send it back with each request.
- 🧩 Makes agents smart, avoids repeating questions, and improves answers.

💡 If you want built-in memory, you can use:

- 🔗 **LangChain**
- 🤖 **OpenAI Assistants API**

## 📝 Example of LLM + Memory Layer

> User: "What is the weather in my city?"  
> Memory Layer: "User lives in Karachi"  
> Agent: Combines memory + user’s message → Sends to LLM  
> LLM: "The weather in Karachi is 23°C"

---

## ✅ Key Points

- 🧠 **Workflows and Agents** can have **both long-term and short-term memory**.
- 🗣️ Memory helps in smart conversation handling.
