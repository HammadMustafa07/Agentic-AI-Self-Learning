# ⚙️ Workflows vs 🤖 Agents  

---

## ⚙️ **Workflows**  

> “Systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.”  

☑️ **Meaning:**  
- 🧑‍💻 You (the developer) decide the steps.  
- 🛤️ The LLM follows the exact logic you wrote.  
- ✅ Best for simple, predictable tasks.  

---

## 🤖 **Agents**  

> “Systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage.”  

☑️ **Meaning:**  
- 🧠 The LLM (with agent loop) can choose what tool to call and when.  
- 🔄 It works within limits you set but is more flexible.  
- ✅ Best for complex, open-ended tasks.

## 🧩 Difference in Simple Words  

| ⚙️ **Workflows** | 🤖 **Agents** |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Fixed logic     | Dynamic decisions |
| You control every step | LLM can decide steps (within limits) |
| For simple, known tasks | For complex, changing tasks |
| Like a checklist ✅ | Like a smart assistant 🤖 |

## ✅ When to Use?  

- Use **Workflows** 🛠️ when tasks are simple and clear.  
- Use **Agents** 🤖 when tasks need the LLM to make decisions.
