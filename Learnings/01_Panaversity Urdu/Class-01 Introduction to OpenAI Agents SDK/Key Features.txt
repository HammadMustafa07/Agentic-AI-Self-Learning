Python_First Design: 
The OPEN AI SDK framework is designed to integrate naturally with python
developers can easily and wuickly make agents to perfrom various tasks. they can define python
functions that will work like agent tools and chain together workflows with without needing
a steep learning curve


Built in Agent Loop:
When we run a agent it automatically enters a loop where it 
sends a prompt to the llm 
check if it needs to use any tool
handles handsoff if needed
repeats until the final output
