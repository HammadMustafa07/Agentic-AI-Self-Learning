01_Prompt Chaining:
This pattern involves breaking user's task into small manageable steps where each step is 
built upon the previous one


02_Routing:
Routing means sending a specific task to the right agent based on what the task is.


03_Parallelization:
Parallelization means running multiple things at the same time instead of one by 
one (sequentially). Itâ€™s like doing multiple tasks together to save time and improve 
efficiency.

04_Orchestrator-Workers:
The orchestrator is like a manager in a company. It breaks down a big task 
into smaller steps, assigns those steps to worker agents who are good at them, 
and then combines all the results to complete the main task

05_Evaluator-Optimizer:
After the worker agent completes its task, the evaluator (or manager) agent 
reviews the output and suggests improvements. This process repeats in a loop 
until the final result meets the desired quality/ff
