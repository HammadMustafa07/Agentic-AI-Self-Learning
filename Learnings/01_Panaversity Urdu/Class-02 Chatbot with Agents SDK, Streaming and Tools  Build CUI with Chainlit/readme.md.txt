**“Class‑02: Chatbot with Agents SDK, Streaming and Tools”**

---

## 📘 Main Concept:

**Build a Smart Chatbot using OpenAI Agents SDK + Chainlit (GUI) with Streaming & Tools**

---

## 🛠️ 1. OpenAI Agents SDK Basics

* **Agent:** A system that interacts with users and tools using OpenAI’s SDK
* **How it works:**

  * Define agent with roles like **system**, **user**, and tools
  * Agent can send messages, get responses, or call functions
  * Works like a brain of chatbot

---

## 🖥️ 2. ChainLit – The GUI for Chatbot

* **ChainLit** = Frontend tool to create a web-based chat interface
* Helps see responses from the agent in real-time
* Used for quick testing & live chat experience

---

## 🌊 3. Streaming Responses

* Normally, agent replies after thinking → **Stream Mode** shows replies **as they are generated**
* Streaming gives **faster feel & better UX**
* Use `stream=True` option when coding agent

---

## 🛠️ 4. Adding Tools & Functions to Agent

* You can make the agent smarter by giving it **tools** (like Calculator, Weather Info, Search)
* The agent decides when to call a tool based on user input
* Example: If user asks math question → agent uses Calculator tool

---

## 🧑‍💻 5. Live Coding Example Highlights

* Code shown step-by-step:

  * Agent setup
  * ChainLit integration
  * Streaming response test
  * Tool calling demo
* Real-time testing shown on local server

---

## 📝 6. Best Practices & Tips

* Keep code modular → separate agent logic, tools, and frontend
* Use ChainLit to visualize and debug
* Streaming is recommended for production-like feel
