# 🤖 Agentic AI Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Agentic AI** learning journey! This repository is a central hub where I explore, build, and document everything I learn about Agentic AI — including real-world implementations using the **OpenAI Agents SDK**, integration with tools like **Gemini** and **OpenRouter**, and design patterns like **hands-off agents**, **tool use**, **task routing**, and **tracing**.

---

## 📘 What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** is a powerful paradigm where AI systems are designed to think and act **autonomously**. Rather than just replying to prompts, agentic models are capable of:

* 🧩 **Chaining**: Breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps
* 🔄 **Routing**: Delegating subtasks to other specialized agents
* 🛠️ **Tool Use**: Interacting with APIs, file systems, browsers, or other services
* 🧠 **Decision-Making**: Making context-aware choices to achieve goals

These systems behave more like intelligent assistants than traditional prompt-based models.

## 🧠 What You'll Find in This Repository

This repository serves as a growing collection of:

* 🔧 **Agent implementations using the OpenAI Agents SDK**
* 🧪 Hands-on experiments with **Google Gemini**, **Anthropic**, and **OpenRouter**
* 🧩 Key agent design patterns, including:

  * `chaining`
  * `routing`
  * `parallelization`
  * `hands-off execution`
  * `tracing & guardrails`
* 📓 Personal notes, breakdowns, and architecture diagrams
* 📚 Real-world AI use cases: Assistants, workflow agents, tool-using agents, and more
* 🗂️ Jupyter notebooks and scripts for experimentation

## 🚀 Repository Goals

This project is designed to:

* 📘 Document my Agentic AI learning journey from the ground up
* 👨‍💻 Provide a reference and learning resource for other developers
* ⚙️ Build a portfolio of real, functional AI agents and tools
* 🚀 Eventually create production-ready agents with planning, memory, and execution capabilities

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* 🧠 **OpenAI Agents SDK**
* 🧩 **Google Gemini API (via OpenAI-compatible endpoints)**
* 🌐 **OpenRouter**
* 🐍 **Python** (with virtual environments, and sometimes FastAPI)
* 📦 **Tools**, **Memory**, **Plans**, and **Action orchestration**

## 🧾 Getting Started

Want to try things out locally? Follow the steps below:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-ai-learning.git

# 2. Navigate to a specific agent project
cd [project-directory]

# 3. Activate your Python virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# 4. Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Run the agent
uv run [agent_file.py]
```

> Make sure you have the required API keys and environment variables configured before running agents that rely on external services.

## 📍 Current Status

🧪 **Actively Learning & Building** — This repository is under continuous development as I explore deeper levels of Agentic AI, experiment with patterns, and implement multi-agent workflows.
